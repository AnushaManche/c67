many fish. They were arrogant and never listened to anyone. In this pond,there also lived a kind-hearted crocodile.

But the fish never listened to him. “There is that crocodile, advising us again," they would say.


One afternoon, the crocodile was resting beside a stone near the pond, when two fishermen stopped there to drink 
water.The fishermen noticed that the pond had many fish. “Look! This pond is full of fish. Let’s come here tomorrow
with our fishing net," said one of them. “I am surprised we have not seen this place before!" exclaimed the other.


The crocodile heard all this. When the fishermen left, he slowly slipped into the pond and went straight to the fish. “You all had better leave this pond before dawn. 
Early morning those two fishermen are going to come to this pond with their net," warned the crocodile.
